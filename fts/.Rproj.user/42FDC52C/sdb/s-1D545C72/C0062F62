A national study showed that influenza immunization reduced pediatric intensive care visits by 74\\% among the immunized\\footnote{http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm}.  Numerous studies point to the benefits not only of those who are immunized, but also those who are near the immunized (such as classmates and teachers)\\footnote{http://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/freeresources/general/flu-vaccine-benefits.pdf}.  \\\\\n\nAn internal FDOH review of school nurse surveillance for the 2013-14 school year found that, after adjusting for non flu season reporting, schools with higher immunization rates had lower incidence of influenza-like illness during the flu season.  This effect was strongest among elementary-aged students (see plot).\n\\includegraphics[height=200, width=280]{elem.png}\n\n%------------------------------------------\n\\subsection*{Student Absenteeism}\n\\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Student Absenteeism}\n%------------------------------------------\nFrom 2011-12 to 2013-14, immunized students in Alachua County Public Schools had a 20-29\\% lower flu season absenteeism rate than their non-immunized peers (see plot). \n\\includegraphics[height=180, width=240]{joePaper-002.pdf}\n\nThough flu season absenteeism varies widely with the intensity of the flu strains each year, the magnitude of the reduction in the flu season absenteeism rate (FSAR) among the immunized in Alachua County schools was consistent and statistically significant (see plot).\n\\includegraphics[height=180, width=240]{econPaper2-026.pdf}\n\nGiven the likelihood of confounding variables, an internal FDOH study was carried out to assess \\emph{Control Flu's} impact on student absenteeism.  This study\\footnote{Available upon request} demonstrated that student immunization was associated with a 10-10.2\\% reduction in the risk of flu season absenteeism, even after controlling for confounding variables such as a student's non flu season absenteeism rate.  \n\n%------------------------------------------\n\\subsection*{Teacher Absenteeism}\n\\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Teacher Absenteeism}\n%------------------------------------------\n\\emph{Control Flu} does not immunize teachers directly, but teachers are some of the program's greatest beneficiaries.  In addition to ensuring that their students remain healthy, evidence from an analysis of teacher absenteeism data suggests that highly-immunized classrooms help protect teachers from illness. Thanks to the phenomenon of \"community immunity\" (see below plot), teaching at a school with an above average immunization rate is associated with an 11\\% reduction in flu season teacher absenteeism. \n\n\\includegraphics[height=160, width=210]{econPaper2-023.pdf}\n\n\n%------------------------------------------\n\\subsection*{Community Health}\n\\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Community Health}\n%------------------------------------------\nImmunizing schoolchildren protects those children and their teachers, but also their parents, siblings and friends.  Alachua County consistently has a significantly lower rate of emergency room visits for influenza like illness, and this is likely due in some part to our very high immunization rates among school-aged children (see plot). \n\\vspace{2mm}\n\n\\includegraphics[height=180, width=200]{iliall.pdf}\n\n\\vfill\n\\columnbreak\n\nImportantly, by immunizing schoolchildren \\emph{en masse}, we can build a \"circle of protection\" around those in our community who are most vulnerable to the flu - infants, the elderly, and those with medical conditions which preclude immunization. 0 to 4 year olds who live in Alachua County have nearly 90\\% lower risk of an emergency room visit for influenza than the same age group in other parts of Florida (see plot). \n\\vspace{3mm}\n\n\n\n\\includegraphics[height=200, width=200]{ili0004.pdf}\n\n\\vspace{2mm}\nThe protective effect extends across age groups (to varying degrees).  The science of community immunity ensures that the entire community benefits when individuals have access to immunizations.  In other words, even non-immunized Alachua residents are safer thanks to \\emph{Control Flu's} efforts (see plot). \\\\\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\n\\includegraphics[height=180, width=200]{ilitime.pdf}\n\n \n\\vfill\n% \\columnbreak\n\\newpage\n\n\\end{multicols}\n\\setkeys{Gin}{width=1\\textwidth}\n\n\n%\\hrulefill\n\\vspace{10mm}\n\n%------------------------------------------\n\\section*{Challenges and Goals}\n\\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Challenges and Goals}\n%------------------------------------------\n\\hrulefill\n\n\\begin{multicols}{2} \n\\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.49\\textwidth}\n\n%------------------------------------------\n\\subsection*{Reaching Out To Older Students}\n\\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Reaching Out To Older Students}\n%------------------------------------------\n\nHistorically, high-schoolers have significantly lower immunization rates than their younger peers.\nInnovative means are needed to better assess high-schoolers' motivations and opinions in regards to influenza immunization - their own health, as well as the health of their teachers, families and friends, could greatly be improved if high schools were to catch up with elementary and middle schools (see plot).\n\n%------------------------------------------\n\\subsection*{Scaling Up Private School Buy-In}\n\\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Scaling Up Private School Buy-In}\n%------------------------------------------\n\nThough private schools achieve only slightly lower immunization rates than public schools, this is largely due to socioeconomic differences.  When socioeconomic differences are controlled for, public schools achieve greater than 10\\% higher immunization rates.  This is likely due to the effect of school nurses and volunteers who \"review and pursue\" unreturned consent forms\\footnote{\"Review and pursue\" refers to the act of making sure that students return Control Flu consent form, regardless of whether their family has chosen for them to be immunized or not.  The rationale for \"reviewing and pursuing\" consent form return is that many families want their child to be immunized but forget or lose the form.}, and ensure that families have a clear understanding of the \\emph{Control Flu} program.\n\n%------------------------------------------\n\\subsection*{Incentivizing Immunization Rates At The Administrative Level}\n\\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Incentivizing Immunization Rates At The Administrative Level}\n%------------------------------------------\nSchools which are similar in social and demographic make-up often have wildly different consent form return and immunization rates.  Yet some schools achieve consistently high (even 100\\%!) consent form return rates every year.  Schools which do best are those at which the principal, teachers and school nurse all work together to ensure that every student has a chance to receive immunization.  Faculty and staff should be provided with an appropriate incentive structure which rewards them for protecting the health of their students and colleagues.  \n\n\\vfill\n\\columnbreak\n%------------------------------------------\n\\subsection*{Working With ACPS To Make Consent Form Return Mandatory?}\n\\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Working With ACPS To Make Consent Form Return Mandatory?}\n%------------------------------------------\n\"Review and pursue\" and incentive restructuring can only go so far.  In order to achieve the immunization rates necessary for true \"community immunity,\" \\emph{Control Flu} needs to ensure that \\textbf{every family} who wants their child immunized has the opportunity to do so.  Internal studies suggest that classrooms which achieve 100\\% consent form return consistently have greater than 60\\% immunization rates.  In other words, 60\\% of families \\emph{want} their child immunized (see plot).\\\\\n\n\\includegraphics[height=150, width=200]{cfrr.pdf}\n\n\nDespite this, many schools achieve well under a 60\\% immunization rate. These schools are almost invariably those which achieve poor consent form return rates.  One potential solution to this problem would be mandatory consent form return.  By bundling consent form return with other obligatory documentation, ACPS could potentially raise immunization rates, free up nurse and teacher time, reduce absenteeism, and prevent illness throughout our community.  \n\n\\vfill\n\\newpage\n\\end{multicols}\n\\setkeys{Gin}{width=1\\textwidth}\n\n\n\n\n\\end{document}",
